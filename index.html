    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hey, I’m Shreyansh Misra 👋
A passionate tech enthusiast from India who loves building things that blend hardware and software.<br><br>

I’m deeply interested in electronics, robotics, automation, embedded systems, and software development. From working with microcontrollers and circuits to designing responsive websites and writing clean code, I enjoy turning ideas into real, working projects.<br>
Currently, I’m focused on:
<ul>
  <li>Strengthening my foundations in programming and system design</li>
  <li>Exploring AI, IoT, and modern web technologies</li>
  <li>Building projects that solve practical, real-world problems</li>
  <li>Continuously learning what today’s tech industry truly demands</li>
</ul>

I believe technology is not just about coding — it’s about creating impact.
My goal is to learn deeply, build consistently, and eventually teach and share knowledge to help others grow in this field. </p>
